In Jest, what are the differences between describe() and it() globals, and what are good uses for them?
Describe() - creates a block that groups together several relate tests. It() is an alias for test which runs a test of a promise. 


What is the point of Test Driven Development? What do you think about this approach?
Helps debug  and test smaller increments of code. I think its its an effective way to deal with errors early on rather than later where it can become more complex. 

Mention three types of automated tests.

- Unit testing 
- Snapshot testing 
- Component testing
